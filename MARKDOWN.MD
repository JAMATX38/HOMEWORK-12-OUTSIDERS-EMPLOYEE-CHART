HOMEWORK 12 SQL: EMPLOYEE TRACKER

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">MY TASK:</span>**

Developers frequently have to create interfaces that allow non-developers to easily view and interact with information stored in databases. These interfaces are called Content Management Systems (CMS). Your assignment this week is to build a command-line application from scratch to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer and MySQL.
